  <h2>Game Description</h2>
  The game TimeFracture is based on a sci-fi, action, side scroller, and shooter game. There will be multiple levels in the game and the last level will be the boss fight. These levels will have many have enemies and obstacles like floor spikes and soldiers firing bullets at you. If you take too much damage then you will die and the game will be over. You will be able to fire your gun to kill your enemies and beside just shooting your gun, you have special time powers that will assist you in combat. These powers are Time Shield which will protect you from any damage for a short amount of time, Time Blast which fires a powerful projectile that does massive damage and goes through multiple amount of enemies, and Time Slow which slows down everything around you except yourself for a short amount of time. Using these time powers will also come with a price, that price is the amount of time power energy that you have. Every time power ablities that you use consumes a certain amount of time power energy you have but can be replenished by collecting fragments of time power energy that appears on certain levels. Health can also be replenished by collecting healthpacks that appear on certain levels too.
