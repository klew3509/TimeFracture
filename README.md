  Game Story:
  A man named William Jackson has the powers to shift through time. He got his power during an accident with an experiment that was held by William’s friends who wanted to help change the past for the better future, but as they demonstrate the idea of time travel to William, there is a malfunction in the system that caused a fracture in time. The reason why William wanted to change the future is because a company named “Micron” took control of the world in the present time. When “Micron” found out that William went in the time machine, they try to find him through time to stop him from changing their fate. William’s mission is to hunt down the headquarters of “Micron” and eliminate the enemies to get the man who started and controls the company. Once “Micron” is defeated, the future and present will be free from “Micron”.

  Game Play:
  The way how the game play will work for our game is that it will be a sci-fi, action, and shooter game. There will be multiple levels in the game and the last level is the boss fight, these levels will be in box like areas where the level will get harder as you progress, these levels will many have enemies and obstacles like jumping on different platforms. The first few levels will be the time to just collect items to help you in the game like energy shields, power orbs, and health packs that you can use manually. To exit the end of the level, you will have to complete the required objective in order to open a portal that will lead to the next level. If you do take too much damage then it will be game over for you. At the end of the game there will be a boss fight who has time powers like you but is difficult since you have to complete many objectives to bring him down and finish him. Besides the ability to just shoot a gun, you also will have powers that can be used if you have enough amount of power to use it. The powers that you have are time freeze for a few seconds, time shield which makes a protective barrier around you, and time blast which would allow you to shoot a powerful projectile at enemies to eliminate them. Be careful how much power you use because you will start off with 100 power level but you can get more if you pick up power orbs. This is the basic game play that is thought about and is not the final game play since some or many things from here will change.
